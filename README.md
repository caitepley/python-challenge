# 
# PyBank contains a Python script titled 'main.py' which reads in data from 'budget_data.csv' (contained in the 'Resources' folder of PyBank).
# The .csv file contains a column of months and a column of profit/loss data. The Python script analyzes the data from the .csv file and outputs the results 
# (total months, total profit/loss, average change, greatest increase, and greatest decrease) to the terminal and to a text file titled 'PyBank_results.txt' 
# (contained in the 'analysis' folder of PyBank). 
#
# PyPoll contains a Python script titled 'main.py' which reads in data from 'election_data.csv' (contained in the 'Resources' folder of PyPoll).
# The .csv file contains a column of ballot ids, a column of counties, and a column candidates. The Python script analyzes the data from the .csv file and 
# outputs the results (total votes, unique candidates, and the winner of the election) to the terminal and to a text file titled 'PyPoll_results.txt' 
# (contained in the 'analysis' folder of PyPoll). 
#
# Installation: Need to have Python and Anaconda installed
#
# To run main.py in PyBank and main.py in PyPoll, you need to be in the directory for each project. The command to run is 'python main.py'
